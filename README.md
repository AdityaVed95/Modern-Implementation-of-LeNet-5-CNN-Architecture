# Implementing-LeNet-5-CNN-Architecture

**LeNet_5_modern_architecture.ipynb** file contains the Modern Architecture of LeNet-5 with key feature listed below : 
1. Max Pooling (instead of Average Pooling)
2. ReLU activation function (instead of tanh or sigmoid)
3. SparseCategoricalCrossentropy Loss & Adam Optimizer
4. Batch Normalization


**LeNet-5-modern-implementation-MNIST-handwritten-digit-recognition.ipynb** file implements the architecture described in the above file on training a CNN for MNIST Hand Written Digit Recognition achieving Test Accuracy of more than 99%
